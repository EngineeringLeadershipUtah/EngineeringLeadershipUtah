# Call for Speakers

Hey everyone! We've secured a venue in Lehi to kick-off the group. We're 
hoping it's central enough to many current and aspiring leaders in 
engineering.  We should be close to announcing our first meetup, which 
likely will be May 14th.

The next challenge I have is the most difficult faced by meetups and user 
groups: finding speakers. We've had a few people reach out with interest 
in speaking, so this document is to help show what we're looking for 
(don't worry, it's nothing crazy).

## Formats

We have several formats that will work well for the meetup:

**Conversation** - This is the easiest of them all: pick a topic to discuss, 
and an "interviewer" will ask open-ended questions to facilitate an 
engaging dialog with you. Following the semi-planned questions, we'll 
include the audience and discussions. The only thing we need from you is 
a topic you're passionate about and a phone call ahead of time to 
brainstorm some questions.

**Presentation** - You can prepare a presentation with slides and talk about 
a subject with the group. Because of the casual nature of meetups, the 
presentation can be as relaxed or formal as you'd like. Meetups are a 
great way to trial run a presentation for a conference. You can plan on 
anywhere from 40-60 minutes for your presentation. 

**Workshop** - If you want something a little more interactive, we can do 
that too! Prepare a workshop or training around a topic, and you will be 
the facilitator. Workshops will require a good deal of preparation, but a 
great way to pilot a training session you would like to give elsewhere.

We're open to other ideas as well!

## Potential Topics

Here are just some ideas to inspire you:

- Conflict Prevention and Conflict Resolution
- Cultivating a Team, Organization, or Company Culture
- Technical Leadership
- Time management, how do you balance both manager and technical 
responsibilities?
- Teamwork
- Managing Technical Debt
- Giving Feedback, Praise, and/or Advice
- Hiring and Interviewing
- Decision Making
- Delegating
- Influencing Others
- A Leadership Philosophy or Management Style
- Motivation & Retention
- Onboarding
- One o on Ones
- Postmortems, Retrospectives
- Performance Reviews
- Setting Team Goals
- Communication
- Growing Team Members
- Managing your career

Whew, those are just *some* of the possible topics!

What makes a good topic? Something you're passionate about and have 
personal experience with. That doesn't mean you have to have lots of 
experience, just that it is based on your own experience. If you're brand 
new engineering manager, and after three months you gave a presentation 
on "Things I learned my first three months of managing" that would be 
fantastic!

## Getting on the Schedule

Ok, we've convinced you. What to do next? Go to the 
[meetup page homepage](https://www.meetup.com/Engineering-Leadership-Utah/), 
on the right-hand side it will show Justin C. as an organizer, and click 
"message" to send me a message. We can coordinate and schedule from 
there.

Thank you for your help getting this group off the ground!
